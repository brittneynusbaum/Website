        <h1>Brittney Nusbaum</h1>
        <p><em>Self Taught Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>My journey to becoming a software engineer began as anyone would expect; by pursuing a degree in Musical Theater from California State University, Chico. While my college education did not move towards a career in coding, I have a strong
          drive
          and desire to start a new career path. For two years I pursued acting by fully immersing myself into the world of theatre in New York City. While theater will always be a passion of mine, I am ready to move on to other goals. Moving back to
          California I found myself yearning to jump into an educational environment to jumpstart a new career. <br> <br>I stumbled across a coding prep course and I was hooked. This is more than just a career change, it’s about pursuing an education
          in something
          that I am immensely passionate about. It is important for me to find a career that I would love to do every
          day, and I am confident that I have found that in web development.</p>
